# Potential Buffer Overflow in Assembly Code

This repository demonstrates a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in a short assembly code snippet. The code attempts to access memory using the `mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]` instruction.  If `ecx` is not properly validated, this could lead to reading from memory locations outside the allocated buffer, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability

The core issue lies in the lack of bounds checking.  `ecx` is used as an index, and if its value exceeds the legitimate range of the target memory region, a buffer overflow will occur.

## Solution

The solution involves adding code that checks the value of `ecx` before executing the memory access. This verification ensures that `ecx` does not point to memory outside the bounds of the allocated space.
